### Introduction

The purpose of the Black Rook OpenAL library is to encapsulate OpenAL's calls
and structures in an object-oriented fashion that makes them easier to work
with in Java, or rather, an object-oriented language. 

### Library

Contained in this release is a series of classes that encapsulate OpenAL
functions and objects. It is connected to the Java Sound Programming Interface
in order to read multiple file formats and types. Support for additional file
types can be added via adding additional Java Sound SPI-compatible decoders to the
classpath.
